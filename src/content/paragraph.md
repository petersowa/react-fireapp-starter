Atlanersa was a Kushite ruler of the Napatan kingdom of Nubia in modern-day
Sudan, reigning for about a decade in the mid-7th-century BC. He was the
successor of Tantamani, the last ruler of the 25th Dynasty of Egypt, and
possibly a son of Taharqa. Atlanersa's reign immediately followed the collapse
of Nubian control over Egypt, which witnessed the conquest by the Assyrians and
then the beginning of the Late Period under Psamtik I. The same period also saw
the progressive cultural integration of Egyptian beliefs into the Kushite
civilization. Atlanersa built a pyramid in the necropolis of Nuri, which
produced many small artefacts now on display in the Museum of Fine Arts in
Boston. Atlanersa's most prominent construction is his temple to the syncretic
god Osiris-Dedwen in Jebel Barkal, which he was able to finish and partially
decorate. The temple entrance was to be flanked with two colossal statues of the
king, one of which was completed and set in place and is now in the National
Museum of Sudan. (Full article...)
